## Project Structure & Module Organization

`kako` is a Rust 2024 workspace for a sandboxed data-transform runner. It
takes jobs (SQL or Python plus inputs) from a pluggable job source, stages the
inputs into a per-run scratch directory, runs the code in a `kekkai` sandbox,
hashes the outputs, and reports outputs and a receipt back to the source. The
workspace has one crate today, `crates/kako` (library with the core types plus
a thin binary). The design is proposed in
[ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-sandboxed-transform-runner.md); nothing runs yet.

Add new code along the boundaries above (job sources, staging, engines,
receipts, run loop) rather than growing `main.rs`. Keep the binary thin. Do
not commit local state (`.state/`, `.kako-state/`), scratch run directories,
staged datasets, outputs, or generated runtime artifacts.

Human documentation: [README.md](README.md). Architecture decisions:
[docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/README.md). `CLAUDE.md` only points here;
this file is canonical.

## Dependencies and Ownership

- **The job source is the authority.** It decides what runs, retries, and
  where results are recorded. kako never decides what runs and never retries
  on its own. The local/CLI source is first-class; adapters for external
  systems (for example
  [Sannrox/sekai-chisei](https://github.com/Sannrox/sekai-chisei)) implement
  the `JobSource` trait and must not leak into the core run loop.
- **[kekkai](https://github.com/Sannrox/kekkai) owns the sandbox.** kako pins
  a kekkai version and never forks, vendors, or patches sandbox code locally.
  Enforcement kako needs lands in kekkai first.

A change that needs a new upstream capability lands and is released upstream
first; kako then bumps its pin in a separate, focused Pull Request. Record
cross-repository predecessors in the Issue's `## GitHub dependencies` section
as full `<owner>/<repo>#<n>` references.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

The compiler is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Local gates match CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo build --locked --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --workspace
bash scripts/validate-workflow-skills.sh
```

- `cargo fmt --all` formats before review.
- `cargo clippy ... -D warnings` is required for ship-level local gates.
- `scripts/validate-workflow-skills.sh` checks that the delivery Skills and
  this file stay linked.

There is no Makefile yet. When one is added, its targets become the source of
truth for these commands and this section must point to them.

GitHub Issues are the planning source of truth. Project-specific Skills live
under `.agents/skills/`. Read `README.md` and accepted ADRs under
`docs/decisions/` before changing system boundaries; record new boundaries,
trust-model changes, and public contracts as ADRs with the
`capture-project-decision` Skill.

## Agent delivery closeout (required)

`cargo test` / Clippy / green CI are **not** a substitute for structured code
review. For non-trivial implementation work (any behavior, security, settings,
or public-API change) that will be **committed, pushed, or opened as a PR**:

1. Run the local gates above via the `verify-change` Skill.
2. Run **`autoreview`** before the ship commit (or before push if the commit
   already exists). **Do not vendor** the autoreview skill into this repo;
   resolve the helper from the shared skill install (first match wins):

   ```bash
   # Preferred: shared agent-skills checkout or global skills home
   if [ -x "${AUTOREVIEW:-}" ]; then :; \
   elif [ -x "$HOME/Projects/agent-skills/skills/autoreview/scripts/autoreview" ]; then
     export AUTOREVIEW="$HOME/Projects/agent-skills/skills/autoreview/scripts/autoreview"
   elif [ -x "${AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/skills/autoreview/scripts/autoreview" ]; then
     export AUTOREVIEW="${AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/skills/autoreview/scripts/autoreview"
   else
     echo "autoreview helper not found; install shared agent-skills or set AUTOREVIEW" >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   # Dirty uncommitted work:
   "$AUTOREVIEW" --mode local
   # Topic branch / open PR (preferred after commit):
   "$AUTOREVIEW" --mode branch --base origin/main
   # Already committed on a clean tree:
   "$AUTOREVIEW" --mode commit --commit HEAD
   ```

3. Treat helper output as advisory: verify each accepted finding in the real
   code, fix actionable ones, rerun tests and autoreview until the helper exits
   0 with no accepted/actionable findings (or document a maintainer judgment
   blocker in the PR).
4. Report in the PR or handoff: commands run, tests, autoreview result
   (clean / findings fixed / consciously rejected).

**Do not skip autoreview** because CI is green, the change is “small,” or the
session is optimizing for throughput unless the user explicitly waived it.
Docs-only typo fixes and pure formatting may skip structured review; state the
waiver. The `deliver-ready-issue` Skill requires this same closeout before
publish/land. Read the shared `autoreview` skill’s `SKILL.md` next to the
resolved helper for engines and findings policy.

## Parallel delivery lanes

A delivery lane is one Issue, one branch, one isolated checkout, one Pull
Request, and one owner. Several agents may deliver several Issues at the same
time, on one machine or on many, only as separate lanes. One Issue is never
split across lanes, and one lane never carries a second Issue.

### Claims live on GitHub

Machines cannot see each other's worktrees, so a claim is only what GitHub
shows. An Issue is claimed, and therefore active, when any of the following
exists:

1. an open Pull Request, draft or ready, that references the Issue;
2. a branch `<type>/<issue>`, or any branch matching `*/<issue>-*`;
3. the authenticated login assigned to the Issue less than six hours ago.

An assignment older than six hours with neither branch nor Pull Request is an
ownership hint, not a veto: report it and ask the maintainer before claiming.
A claim is stale once its Issue is closed or its Pull Request has merged; its
owner or the maintainer removes it. Any other takeover first preserves the
existing branch, Pull Request, and evidence and requires the maintainer's
confirmation, unless the lead of the same parallel run owns the stalled lane.

A lane claims before it implements, under Publish or Land authority or with an
explicit claim authorization under Implement, using
`bash .agents/skills/deliver-ready-issue/scripts/issue-lane.sh claim <issue>`:

- the branch `<type>/<issue>` is created on GitHub from the default branch by
  an atomic ref creation, so when two machines race exactly one claim
  succeeds and the other sees `claimed`;
- the authenticated login is assigned to the Issue, which shows the claim in
  the Issue list and timestamps it in the Issue timeline.

`<type>` is derived deterministically so that every machine computes the same
branch: the Conventional Commit type in the Issue title, with `bug` mapped to
`fix`; otherwise the type label (`bug` → `fix`, `enhancement` → `feat`,
`documentation` → `docs`); otherwise `chore`. Lane branches carry no slug
because the name is the claim; the Pull Request title carries the description.
Human topic branches may keep `<type>/<issue>-<slug>` and are detected as
claims by the same rule.

An Implement-only lane cannot claim and is invisible to other machines. Say so
in the report, or ask for claim authority before starting.

### Isolation on each machine

Local isolation protects lanes that share a machine; it is not a claim.

- Each lane checks out its claim branch in `.worktrees/issue-<issue>` inside
  the repository, ignored by Git. A fresh clone dedicated to the lane, as on a
  cloud agent, is equivalent. The base SHA is recorded in the lane report.
- The primary checkout belongs to the maintainer. Agents never switch its
  branch, reset it, stash it, or run long jobs in it while another lane is
  active.
- A worktree serves exactly one Issue. Finished lanes are removed; a worktree is
  never reused for a different Issue or renamed to hide its origin.
- Shared Git state is mutated in short, serialized slots: `git fetch --prune`,
  worktree creation and removal, local branch deletion, and merging belong to
  the lead of a parallel run or happen one lane at a time on a shared machine.
  A lane commits and publishes its own branch from its own worktree; that is
  not a shared mutation. Nobody holds a slot across implementation, test runs,
  or a remote wait.

### Limits, collisions, and landing

The three-lane limit counts claims visible on GitHub per repository: open
implementation Pull Requests plus claim branches without one. Assigned or
planned work with neither is not a running lane.

Parallel lanes must not collide. Collision surfaces in this repository are the
`JobSource` trait and receipt format, the `kekkai` sandbox pin, the run
directory layout (staging, outputs, hashing,
cleanup), and the runtime image with its Python package set. Lanes that would
both change one of these surfaces run in sequence, not in parallel.

A lane publishes its first Verified commit to the claim branch as a draft Pull
Request that closes the Issue. Public GitHub lane fields may list only: claim
branch, repo-relative worktree (for example `.worktrees/issue-N` — never an
absolute path), base SHA, and published SHA. Keep absolute paths and
machine/host names in the private agent session only. It marks the Pull
Request ready when verification and review are complete. Immediately before
publishing, the lane fetches and confirms that the default branch is an
ancestor of its head; it refreshes onto `main` only for a conflict, a failing
gate, an explicit request, or a sibling landing on a shared surface, not
merely because `main` advanced.

Landing is sequential. After each merge, fetch, recompute the frontier, and let
the remaining lanes recheck `mergeable` against the new `main`. A failed or
timed-out merge response may still have merged; reconcile the remote state
before retrying.

The lead of a parallel run keeps a ledger per lane: Issue, branch, base SHA,
owner, state, Pull Request, evidence, blockers, and cleanup. Keep hostnames
and absolute checkout paths in the session with the maintainer, never on
GitHub. Report verified outcomes, not launched work. The executable lead
procedure is `.agents/skills/deliver-ready-issue/references/parallel-delivery.md`.

## Ontology Policy

For work involving portable ontology definitions, classes, relations,
provenance, validation, import, export, or structural queries, always use the
project-local `sekai-ontology` Skill in `.agents/skills/sekai-ontology/`.

Select the ontology database explicitly with `--db <path>` or `SEKAI_DB` when
the resolved default is not the intended file, then run `sekai --json validate`
before relying on its contents. Treat successful ontology output as structured
repository evidence, preserve its provenance in answers, and state when
validation fails or the requested fact is absent rather than inferring it. Do
not use a run scratch directory or a job source database as a portable
ontology database.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow standard Rust formatting with `cargo fmt` and keep modules aligned with
the domain boundaries above. Use `snake_case` for files, modules, functions, and
variables; use `PascalCase` for types and traits; use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for
constants. Keep job sources, staging, execution, and reporting behind small traits so
the run loop can be tested without any external system. Fail closed: when a
job source reports a lost claim, the sandbox cannot be applied, or a limit cannot be set,
abort the run and report it rather than degrade. User Python is data to the
runner, never code the runner imports; the runner itself stays Rust. Individual
units of work are **runs** of a transform.

## Testing Guidelines

Add focused tests for the run loop (job failure, limit hits, source errors),
input staging, sandboxed execution, output hashing, receipts, and
scratch cleanup on success, failure, and timeout. Prefer deterministic tests
with a fake job source. Mark tests that need an external job source, a Python
runtime, or kernel sandbox features as ignored, and document their
prerequisites in the test. Offline `cargo test` must stay green without any
external system.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use short imperative subjects, often Conventional Commit style:
`feat(source): read jobs from a local directory`,
`fix(stage): remove the scratch workspace on timeout`,
`docs: document the run workspace layout`. Keep commits narrow and describe the affected
subsystem when useful. Pull requests should include a concise behavior
summary, **tests run**, **autoreview result** (for non-trivial code), linked
issue or context, and any configuration, compatibility, or security
implications. `.agents/skills/` is tracked; do not treat it as gitignored.
Record user-visible changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.

### Public hygiene

This repository is public. Never put hostnames, FQDNs, IP addresses, home
directories, absolute worktree paths, LAN or employer network names, deployment
or environment state, image or artifact digests, tenant or customer names,
release-hold or rollout-hold language, or other private environment inventory on
Issues, Pull Requests, comments, commit messages, ADRs, or docs. Describe
behavior and versions instead (for example "after the sandbox release" rather
than an environment name, a digest, or a hold).

### Verified commits on GitHub

Prefer publishing PR branch tips with GitHub-signed commits so GitHub shows
**Verified**:

1. Implement and commit locally as usual (`commit.gpgsign` may still apply).
2. Publish the branch tip with `bash scripts/gh-verified-push.sh` instead of a
   plain `git push` when you want the hosted commit Verified (GraphQL
   `createCommitOnBranch`). That path creates one server-side commit with the
   local `HEAD` tree; committer is typically **GitHub**.
3. New branch:
   `bash scripts/gh-verified-push.sh --create-branch-from origin/main --branch <topic> --sync-local`
4. Existing PR branch:
   `bash scripts/gh-verified-push.sh --branch <topic> --sync-local`
   (uses the current remote tip as `expectedHeadOid`).
5. Never pass `--no-gpg-sign` for local commits; if GPG fails, stop and fix it.
6. After publish, confirm `verification.verified=true` (the script prints this).

When merging PRs, prefer **squash** (`gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`) so
the land commit on `main` is also GitHub-signed/Verified and history stays
linear. Use `gh pr merge --merge` only when multi-commit history must be kept
(original SHAs preserved). Avoid GitHub **rebase** merges when Verified history
matters: rebase-merge rewrites commits and drops signatures. Do not rewrite
protected `main` after merging unless the user explicitly approves; if
protection is temporarily relaxed, restore force-push and status-check settings
immediately after the correction.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit secrets, tokens, credentials, staged datasets, run outputs, logs,
or local state. User code never gets network access: Python packages are baked
into the runtime image, never installed at run time. Report suspected sandbox
escapes or cross-run data leaks privately (GitHub private vulnerability
reporting or the maintainer), never in a public Issue. Never put hostnames,
FQDNs, IP addresses, home directories, absolute worktree paths, LAN or employer
network names, deployment or environment state, image or artifact digests,
tenant or customer names, release-hold or rollout-hold language, or other
private environment inventory on public Issues, Pull Requests, comments, or
commit messages.
