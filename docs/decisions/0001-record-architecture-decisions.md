# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-09
- Supersedes: —

## Context

kako sits between job sources, the sandbox it uses, and the engines it runs.
Boundary choices between these are expensive to reverse and need to be findable after the PR that made them.

## Decision

Record architecture decisions as numbered Markdown files in `docs/decisions/`,
with status, date,
context, decision, consequences, and rejected alternatives.

Write an ADR when a choice changes a public boundary (the job source
contract, the receipt format, sandbox guarantees, runtime image contents), chooses among durable
alternatives, or would need a migration to reverse. Small fixes and local
refactors do not need one.

## Consequences

Each boundary change links an ADR. Superseded ADRs stay in place and name
their successor.
