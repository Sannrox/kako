description: Verify a kako Rust, documentation, configuration, or workflow change with proportionate deterministic checks. Use after implementation, before review, or when a contributor needs an exact evidence report without overstating unrun tests.

# Verify Change

Run the narrowest useful checks first, then expand according to change risk.

## Procedure

1. Inspect `git status`, the diff, and the stated outcome. Preserve unrelated
   worktree changes. Use `assess-change-impact` when risk is unclear. Complete
   when every changed path is classified.
2. Run focused tests for the affected module or crate first. Add checks
   based on the surface:

   | Surface | Required evidence |
   | --- | --- |
   | Rust source | focused tests plus the full local gates below |
   | job source, adapters, receipts | tests with a fake job source covering success, job failure, limit hits, and source errors; receipts complete and deterministic |
   | staging, hashing, cleanup | deterministic tests: identical inputs give identical hashes; scratch removed on success, failure, and timeout |
   | sandboxed execution | the run is spawned through kekkai with no network and limits set; kernel-dependent tests skip with an explicit message |
   | dependency pins (kekkai, adapter clients) | `Cargo.lock` diff reviewed; the pinned tag exists upstream; upstream release notes read |
   | runtime image / Python packages | image builds; package set matches the documented policy |
   | configuration | parsing/default tests and the docs that describe the setting |
   | docs/templates/Skills | links and commands where practical; `bash scripts/validate-workflow-skills.sh` |

3. Before ship-level handoff, run the same gates as CI
   (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) unless the user explicitly requested a
   narrower check:

   ```sh
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo build --locked --workspace --all-targets
   cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --locked --workspace
   bash scripts/validate-workflow-skills.sh
   ```

   CI is the source of truth for the command set; if it changes, follow it and
   update `AGENTS.md`. Complete when every applicable local gate has a result.
4. Keep service- or kernel-dependent tests ignored or explicitly skipped unless
   prerequisites are intentionally available. Never print secrets or persist
   live payloads. Complete when skipped checks name both the reason and
   residual risk.
5. Review failures against the changed scope. Report pre-existing failures with
   evidence; do not relabel a failure as pre-existing without comparison.

## Output

Report:

- commands run and pass/fail result;
- focused behavior covered;
- checks skipped with reasons;
- failures and whether they block the stated outcome; and
- remaining uncertainty.

Never use “all tests pass” unless all stated tests actually ran and passed.
Remote CI may be unavailable; local evidence must then stand on its own and the
report says so.

## Relationship to autoreview

`verify-change` is **deterministic** local evidence only. It does **not** replace
structured second-model review. For non-trivial code that will be committed or
opened as a PR, run the **shared** `autoreview` helper after verify-change and
before ship (see `AGENTS.md` “Agent delivery closeout” and
`deliver-ready-issue`). Do not vendor that skill into this repository.
